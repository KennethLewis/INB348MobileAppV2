KeepUp

Currently the application contains a few main pages but mainly to navigate through to certain areas.
The main implementation of the application is contained in the "UnitsActivity" where by students can
access subjects that they are enrolled in and post various comments to that subjects content area.
Currently within that class students have to be added in and out via commenting, however later on
the database will check and verify the user exists and let them in.

In order to run the program the "MainActivity" must be opened and run. Program was tested on a HTC One
with the current Android OS version, as well as being testing on an emulator using the eclipse framework.

To reset posts across all student subjects press the top right navigation dots and click the "Settings" option
which will wipe the database and start again.
